		<h2>Research Fields</h2>

		<h3>Variational Analisis and Dynamical Systems</h3>
		<p align="justify">I study nonsmooth dynamical systems, induced by descent dynamics, sweeping processes and other variational dynamics. I’m also interested in nonsmooth first-order calculus in the convex and nonconvex setting.</p>
		<h3>Differential geometry in Variational Analysis</h3>
		<p align="justify">I study the differential structure of mathematical objects in the context of variational analysis, such that the metric projection, manifolds in Hilbert spaces, o-minimal structures, among others.</p>
		<h3>Optimization and Game Theory</h3>
		<p align="justify">I’m interested in optimization and equilibrium problems in several settings, such as quasiconvex equilibrium problems, nonsmooth optimization, variational formulations, bilevel optimization and Multi-Leader-Follower games, both in the deterministic and stochastic setting. I study both, theoretical aspects and algorithms.</p>
		<h3>Applications of Optimization and Learning</h3>
		<p align="justify">I am interested in high impact problems where optimization, game theory and learning are involved. I study applications of these theories, such that sharing economies, cryptocurrencies, design of exchange networks and opinions in social networks.<br> Problems in renewable energy, and management of natural resources have been one of my research lines in the recent years. I am also interested in problems of Operations research, logistic and economics in general.</p>
